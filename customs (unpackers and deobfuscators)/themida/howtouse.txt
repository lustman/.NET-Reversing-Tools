How to use?
Just drag .NET file and select pd.exe! (32bit to 32bit, 64bit to 64bit)
pd.exe will dump file! if not, just manual dump with SCYLLA!!!!!
you have to install vbruntime and .NET runtime etc.... JUST INSTALL VISUAL STUDIO .NET, C++, Universal Windows Platform!!!!!! :)

How it works?
Search DLLS, if "clrjit.dll" found, suspend process and dump.

What should I do after dump?
just de4dot it!
